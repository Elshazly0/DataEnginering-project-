

**Overview of used dataset**

The dataset is covering the history of the

Olympic Games, from Athens in 1896 through Rio in

2016.



**Overview the Project Goal**

The project goal is to go through complete

data engineering process:

➢Exploring the data

➢Cleaning the data

➢Data reduction

➢Handling outliers & missing values



**Steps of work done**

● We explored the dataset features

● Make sure that the data is understandable

● Discovering relations between the data

● Setting some research questions

● We started cleaning the data by:

    ○ Reducing the dimensionality of the data

    ○ Identifying outliers

    ○ Handling the missing values by placing

    them with mean/median of some specific

    data

● Then we started plotting the data by finding

the best visual to presentation



**Data Exploration Questions/RQ**

1. Women participation & performance in the Olympic games over time

2.The correlation between the countries and a specific sport

3.Participation/evolution of each sport over time

4.How the age of the participants differs over time

5.How many summer and winter season of the Olympic games in comparison, and how the number of participants changed
